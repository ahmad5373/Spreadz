  "TodayWorlds" : " In today's world, digital customer acquisition is booming. Unfortunately, however, the entire competition also romps around in it. It is particularly difficult for smaller companies to assert themselves against the 'big players'. With Spreadz, customers advertise for customers in a simple, uncomplicated and unobtrusive way. Since customers share the advertising digitally with friends and acquaintances, they quickly achieve a very large reach. The advertising looks familiar, as it comes from a well-known person, and has a positive influence on the purchase decision. Since the referrer is only rewarded when a purchase or business transaction occurs, the company only pays when it actually benefits from it. Thus, Spreadz is a win-win-win system: the referrer wins a premium, the company gains a new customer, and the new customer benefits from an offer.",
