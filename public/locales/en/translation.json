  "TodayWorlds": " In today's world, digital customer acquisition is booming. Unfortunately, however, the entire competition also romps around in it. It is particularly difficult for smaller companies to assert themselves against the 'big players'. With Spreadz, customers advertise for customers in a simple, uncomplicated and unobtrusive way. Since customers share the advertising digitally with friends and acquaintances, they quickly achieve a very large reach. The advertising looks familiar, as it comes from a well-known person, and has a positive influence on the purchase decision. Since the referrer is only rewarded when a purchase or business transaction occurs, the company only pays when it actually benefits from it. Thus, Spreadz is a win-win-win system: the referrer wins a premium, the company gains a new customer, and the new customer benefits from an offer.",

  "AboutUs_MainTitle": "The digital form of word-of-mouth propaganda",
  "AboutUs_Para1": "In sales and marketing, new ways are always being sought to expand one's own radius and to acquire more and more new customers. To achieve this, most companies invest large sums of money in various marketing campaigns.",
  "AboutUs_Para2": "In recent years, these campaigns have become increasingly digital and mostly online. On the one hand, this makes you much more flexible, and on the other hand, you can use online methods to specifically address your own target group and have much less wastage. The costs are also considerably lower than expensive poster campaigns, print advertising or TV spots.",
  "AboutUs_Para3": "The very best method is still word of mouth, the personal recommendation of a trusted person. This usually means that a purchase decision has already been made before a sales discussion can take place. This creates a completely different service provider-customer relationship than with other methods, where the interest of a potential customer is aroused.",
  "AboutUs_Para4": "It was with this in mind that we developed Spreadz. A tool with which your customers can recommend you or your company to their friends and acquaintances.A personal recommendation that can be shared digitally as often as desired to all possible interested parties within seconds. They, in turn, find their way to the recommended service provider or product via the personalized link or personalized voucher code. Quick and uncomplicated.",
  "AboutUs_Subtitle1": "Online marketing without IT knowledge:",
  "AboutUs_Para5": "Spreadz was developed as a tool for everyone and is therefore easy to use for everyone. The account can be set up and designed individually on a smartphone or PC. All texts and messages to potential customers can be written by the user in their own words.",
  "AboutUs_Para6": "The user can create their own recommendation campaigns. The tool automatically generates a QR code for each campaign, which the recommenders can use to go directly to the campaign. The recommendations and the statistics of the campaign are displayed in the respective campaign.It is child's play and no IT knowledge is required to use Spreadz.",
  "AboutUs_Subtitle2": "Google star collector as a Spreadz side effect",
  "AboutUs_Para7": "During the recommendation process, future recommenders are asked to leave a review on Google. Spreadz links to the user's company's Google profile. Experience has shown that companies that had fewer Google reviews suddenly received more reviews on Google. It was also noticeable that the Google reviews that came about through Spreadz were generally good. This is because the customer makes the review on the spot and only if they were satisfied with the service.",
  "AboutUs_Subtitle3": "Guaranteed success with Spreadz",
  "AboutUs_Para8": "Even if it is ultimately the user who determines the success of an advertising tool, it is almost impossible for Spreadz to fail to be successful. This can only really happen if you withhold the QR coder or the link from the customer. Because once the customer immerses themselves in the world of Spreadz and shares it with their WhatsApp contacts, the response is guaranteed. If you use the tool consistently, it is pure logic that the customer base will grow. For example, one customer becomes three, three become nine, and so on. This is infinitely scalable.",
  "AboutUs_Subtitle4": "Your customers become advertising media",
  "AboutUs_Para9": "With Spreadz you turn your customers into advertising media. Completely automatically. They will recommend you again and again and you will always be confronted with new inquiries.Â The leads can be viewed live at any time and are waiting to be processed. This means that the appointment or closing rate is extremely high and you can work efficiently and without wastage.",
  "AboutUs_Para10": "Grow with Spreadz and let us become part of your success story!",
  "OurStory_MainQuote": "But what does the web app have to do with \"spreading\" anyway? The logo also gives it away. The \"S\" has an arrow at the top and bottom. \"It stands for multiplying, sharing and distributing, and that's exactly what I want to achieve with this app.\" Sonderegger also wants to offer companies the opportunity to establish themselves and draw attention to themselves.",

  "OurStory_ChrisSection1": "During my 17-year career in sales, I was always looking for new ways to get new customers. Deviating from the usual methods such as telemarketing, online leads and billboard advertising, I dedicated myself to referral management early on. In the beginning, I was personally recommended by customers, then I used flyers with QR codes and finally",
  "OurStory_ChrisSection2": "Online forms that I had my clients fill out. However, I always felt limited with these solutions. I kept experimenting until I finally got closer to the idea of Spreadz.",
  "OurStory_ChrisSection3": "In the spring of 2023, I met Phil, who had already made great strides in lead generation on the internet. He was so enthusiastic about my idea that we decided to develop the tool together. The result is an online tool that enables any company to turn its customers into digital advertisers and reward them individually.",
  "OurStory_ChrisSection4": "With Spreadz, customers advertise for customers, but online. As a result, there are hardly any limits to recommendations, and they are infinitely scalable. The Internet knows no national borders. Every Spreadz action can be shared worldwide in real-time. As a positive side effect, companies are automatically rated by customers on Google. The idea behind this is that companies also get more positive reviews through recommendations. After all, hardly anyone who recommends a company to others will rate it badly. With this promotion, even more customers will find their way to companies that use Spreadz.",
  "OurStory_ChrisSection5": "We decided to offer Spreadz as a web app so that everyone can access it without having to download a separate app. In the test phase, I was able to increase my recommendation rate fivefold, while the completion rate, as with recommendations,",
  "OurStory_ChrisSection6": "usual, remained enormously high. Spreadz has had a lasting impact on my everyday life in sales.",
